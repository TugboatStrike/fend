## Description

The project uses the initial starter code to create the functional webpage. The
HTML and CSS has not been changed except to create the links and folder
structure as needed.

This depends on the javascript to build out the navigation based on the section
information. The active section is also highlighted depending on it's visible
position in the viewport.

The HTML did have an additional section created to meet specification.
